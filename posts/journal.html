                            Ok so I remembered that the reason I stopped in the middle of making this was that I want it to be
                            so that newest posts are on top, and then I got lost in the rabbithole of thinking of better 
                            ways to go about making this blog page work instead of just publishing it. It's 8 am. There's a 
                            plane going by outside my window, and my tummy hurts.

                            Hello hello hello ! I've been meaning to make this page for quite
                            some time now,, but every time i work on my website I get irritated by the
                            state of things. Unfortunately, i keep putting off making a new page for Who 
                            knows how long, so i might just have to do with making updates on this one for 
                            the time being. 
                            <br>
                            So - I've been wanting a sort-of low effort daily journal I can update sporadically
                            on this blog at the end of days or such, but the effort of making a whole new
                            html page was enough to dissuade me, so I'm going to try just putting them all in one 
                            big ass rolling page and just update it as i go. hopefully this works for letting me 
                            journal on here and i don't get bothered by typing on a html document or by my weird 
                            font scaling that im too lazy to fix or by (endless list of issues i will not resolve)
