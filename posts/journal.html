                            Today was pretty okay ! It's monday, it's a holiday at the company my company works for, but it wasn't a holiday for me, so I
                            did work, but I basically did nothing all day. Because of this I was capable of listening to music uninturrupted almost all day, which
                            was incredibly satisfying. I've been really enjoying electronic music again and I'm really gassed about it. It only took like
                            six months of listening to almost exclusively slowcore or bladee ! I had a really good valentines day hanging out w/ my sister
                            last weekend. I'm not really sure I've ever had a good time on valentine's day, so I'm marking this down as a big win for 2026.
                            I finalized my planning for my trip to Seattle next month and I get to see a bunch of close friends and I've also never been!
                            I'm really looking forward to the next month, I have a lot of music events that are coming up - it feels like it's been an 
                            eternity since I've had this, so we're putting this one in the Yayyy 2026 pile as well. My meds also feel like they've been 
                            working - I haven't been super depressed, I also haven't been really manic or anything, just been feeling relatively normal.
                            I still feel really uninspired and unmotivated and it's difficult to focus, I tried to get back on my adhd meds and it only 
                            took a few days for me to start feeling physically bad on them / for my tension headaches to return. Unfortunately might just
                            have to epically life my life without them and figure out my own little strategies to focus on stuff. I'm confident I can 
                            figure it out in my own little way. This update has been really dry, I don't really feel like my inner voice has much 
                            cohesion right now, but I figure I would just write a little update of what's up in my head. I'm also feeling really self-confident 
                            this week, which really slaps Extremely hard, and hopefully it sticks around. Okay, goodbye !

                            <br>
                            Sometimes I'm struck with such an incredible sense of loneliness that I end up feeling 
                            completely insecure in all of my ongoing relationships. When this happens, I'm never quite
                            sure if I'm being paranoid and delusional or if I'm finally feeling lucid. I can easily justify 
                            either opinion in my brain, but it's much easier to gravitate towards the latter, since I'm already
                            feeling isolated and unable to reach out to anyone for anything more meaningful than a short discord text chat. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            When I feel like this, my immediate urge is to surround myself with people, so I normally go sit around
                            in a vrchat instance for basically every single waking hour. This only really helps insofar as to
                            keep me away from my own thoughts when I'm there and constantly engaged in communication. The downside
                            to this is that I have to be constantly engaged in communication; I don't feel better just because I'm 
                            surrounded by a bunch of people that I have no urge to talk to. So I basically end up feeling like my 
                            mood is regulated by the ebb and flow of people that are willing to talk to me. I don't particularly 
                            care what we talk about, and I'm perfectly happy to listen to really whatever they want to talk about.
                            But I feel bad communicating in this way. I think I have great conversations and I get to learn a lot
                            about really interesting people, but the underlying motivation of seeking this out for a sense of relief
                            makes me feel like I'm using and churning through people for my own gain. This obviously feels rather
                            awful and it makes me feel like a bad person. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Unsurprisingly, then, I've spent a good deal of time thinking about the morality of this all, and I've found it 
                            relatively difficult to come to a conclusion on.
                            Is everyone at a bar an evil person if they're seeking connection out of loneliness and desperation? I don't
                            think I would call those people evil. Are they evil if they don't make their intent clear when they talk to someone?
                            I think that's obviously very situational, but I don't think you should have to say "Hi, I'm here because I feel sad!"
                            every time you start a conversation. But regardless of that, I can't shake the feeling that this behavior is negative
                            for basically everybody involved. I mean, I don't think that's really a huge surprise. When I put it out plain on paper ("paper"),
                            I'm just forming short term connections that I wish would be extremely meaningful because I'm feeling too insecure in 
                            my already-meaningful connections that I have. Or maybe I'm trying to use other people to satiate a feeling that only I can 
                            affirm or find for myself? Ultimately, I don't think it's too crazy to conclude that this is related to my already deep-seated
                            attachment issues that I've battled with for quite some time. But the knowledge or self-awareness of these things doesn't really
                            make it easier to reach out to friends or to not feel a stinging and awful physical pain when I'm alone. And my friends encouraging
                            me to hang out or affirming me or whatever doesn't really seem to do a whole lot when I'm in this state of mind. And honestly,
                            when I feel like this, I don't really know how I ever felt any other kind of way. It feels impossible right now to imagine that I've
                            ever felt secure in a relationship or that I could have ever sat alone with myself without feeling some horrific sense of dread.
                            None of this is to even say that I feel particularly sad. I feel relatively apathetic right now, and when I'm alone or 
                            undistracted I feel scared.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I think the whole point of writing all of this is to express that I really feel like a whore, and I don't want to say that 
                            in the sense that I look down on anyone who is sexually open or active. I think that's actually really cool! 
                            But in this case I feel kind of disgusted with myself, because all I've been doing is hopping around and desperately trying to 
                            garner the attention of people who I probably wouldn't want to talk to in a month. Thinking about that makes me feel pretty sick! 
                            Again -- I can't really tell if I'm just overthinking things or if I'm the most evil and manipulative person in the world. 
                            Perhaps I'm just in the middle of an unfortunate manic episode, but it would certainly be a very confusing one, since I don't feel very good 
                            or energetic or capable or any of the normal signifiers at all. Really the only tells are the socialization and my extremely strong 
                            increase in drug-seeking behavior, although I've managed to stave off taking action on the latter for the most part. And again, the potential of
                            me being aware of this doesn't really ease the fact that I'm in the middle of this crushing spiral with basically no idea how to get out.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I don't have a great conclusion on any of this. I'm probably going to keep doing whatever I'm doing and I'll continue to feel somewhat bad 
                            about it, and I'm going to keep working on myself and trying to better myself in the meantime. I'm also clearly not doing such
                            a great job at my previously-mentioned idea of not intellectualizing all of my emotional experiences in 2026. 
                            I'm trying to encourage myself to seek therapy again. I think this is definitely the kind of thing that getting a therapist 
                            would help with, but it's very difficult for me to go through the logistical nightmare of getting an appointment with one and especially
                            after having a good handful of absolutely horrid ones in the past. I can't fully convince myself it will help, even though 
                            in my rational mind I know it will. I just have to suck it up and do the relatively easy thing despite having convinced myself 
                            that it's too difficult. Hopefully I can do that before I leave myself with more lasting emotional and mental damage from self-destructive 
                            and confusing tendencies. And happy new years. It's just as confusing of a January than I could have ever dreamed and hoped for.

                            Ok so I remembered that the reason I stopped in the middle of making this was that I want it to be
                            so that newest posts are on top, and then I got lost in the rabbithole of thinking of better 
                            ways to go about making this blog page work instead of just publishing it. It's 8 am. There's a 
                            plane going by outside my window, and my tummy hurts.

                            Hello hello hello ! I've been meaning to make this page for quite
                            some time now,, but every time i work on my website I get irritated by the
                            state of things. Unfortunately, i keep putting off making a new page for Who 
                            knows how long, so i might just have to do with making updates on this one for 
                            the time being. 
                            <br>
                            So - I've been wanting a sort-of low effort daily journal I can update sporadically
                            on this blog at the end of days or such, but the effort of making a whole new
                            html page was enough to dissuade me, so I'm going to try just putting them all in one 
                            big ass rolling page and just update it as i go. hopefully this works for letting me 
                            journal on here and i don't get bothered by typing on a html document or by my weird 
                            font scaling that im too lazy to fix or by (endless list of issues i will not resolve)
