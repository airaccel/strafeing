                            this one might take me a minute to write Bear with me thanks. <br>
                            <br> that being said, this whole part of my website is still under heavy construction and i plan
                            on moving it to a static site generator and allowing for rss feed integration in the very near
                            future. so if you're wondering why it's all spaced out like shit it's all intentional and it's cause
                            i love that . . . <br>
                            update 11/12/24 so i Have actually found a perfect static site generator but. <br>
                            i think it's gonna take a good bit of styling to get the website to look the way i want (bad), so
                            i'm still not there yet with the revamp. 
                            plus, i need to figure out how to port my god-awful photography page over if i do convert to a markdown->html 
                            based website. that being said, these are all exciting problems to have and i look forward to figuring them out.

                            update 7/18/25 <br>
                            soo it's been a dang while and i never ended up writing this post, but if you know me, you probably know i've been pretty annoying about both my politics and also
                            my stance on why people should carve their own spaces out on an internet that is firstmost extremely hostile but also Simply just unfun to use nowadays.<br>
                            so why did i make this? it's pretty simple. i want a place to put my stuff, i want to learn new things, and i want a space that isn't social media.
                            social media still makes me feel uncomfortable, i hate talking on there, i only post on there when i'm feeling psychotic, which normally feels really good but it probably isn't.
                            anyway, an update. i'm working on porting this website over to jekyll. i've been really emotonally struggling lately so it's been taking a long time, but i've made some progress.
                            i really was struggling to decide on an art direction, but i think if i don't just start, i'll probably get stuck and think about it forever. maybe i need to give myself a deadline.<br>
                            Soooooooooooooo let's say by wednesday of next week i should have a functional theme. This seems like a really lofty goal, since i'm djing in person for the first time in a while next week,
                            and i'm quite anxious about that, so stacking another responsibility on top of things feels pretty bad, but i'm also excited by the idea, and i think doing more things is always better than doing less.
                            i don't get excited about life when i sit in front of my computer and think about how miserable things can get (when i'm doing nothing). even typing this is pretty fun, yay ! <br>
                            Anyway, that's about it for the update. I'll check back in soon, byebye!
