                            this one might take me a minute to write Bear with me thanks. <br>
                            <br> that being said, this whole part of my website is still under heavy construction and i plan
                            on moving it to a static site generator and allowing for rss feed integration in the very near
                            future. so if you're wondering why it's all spaced out like shit it's all intentional and it's cause
                            i love that . . . <br>
                            update 11/12/24 so i Have actually found a perfect static site generator but. <br>
                            i think it's gonna take a good bit of styling to get the website to look the way i want (bad), so
                            i'm still not there yet with the revamp. 
                            plus, i need to figure out how to port my god-awful photography page over if i do convert to a markdown->html 
                            based website. that being said, these are all exciting problems to have and i look forward to figuring them out.
