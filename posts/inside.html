                            one hundred handwritten words on electronic paper <br>
                            a mark at the crease of your walls<br>
                            the hum of a radio beyond the glass<br>
                            a promise, held dear for all the wrong reasons<br>
                            <br>
                            you tell yourself that you will not be scared when you die<br>
                            in the same tone you use to imagine that<br>
                            there's always been an immeasurable distance<br>
                            between us<br>
                            <br>
                            is it really such a shame to live your whole life in a room?<br>
                            it's comfortable,<br>
                            even if the air gets stale<br>
                            and there's flowers just outside<br>
                            beyond the glass.<br>
                            is it okay for you to watch them?<br>
                            even though you sit inside your room,<br>
                            an immeasurable distance away,<br>
                            as they wilt. <br>
                            would it be more humane to look away?<br>
                            <br>
                            it's funny, because<br>
                            the flower dies first,<br>
                            but you rot twice as fast<br>
                            so when you inevitably find that you're terrified to die, <br>
                            you pointlessly ask:<br>
                            <br>
                            was it really such a shame to live this whole life in a room?<br>
                            was there ever really any distance at all, between us?<br>
                            and<br>
                            was it cruel to you when i looked away?<br>
