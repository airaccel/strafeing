                        <p>i made this site so that i can put the stuff i like or make somewhere
                            that isn't tracking you or running javascript or doing anything terrible.
                            also i get to make it look horrible! What a blessing . . . <br>
                            (im currently working on a new website! come back in a little while maybe yay !)

                            <li>im 27 i live in the DMV area im a girl Sort of (its complicated) and im sexy and beautiful </li>
                            <li>i am a serial hyperfixator. here's some of my hobbies and passions:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>i listen to a lot of music and i DJ for fun with my friends On Line. 
                                        i like any music that sounds like it feels good. and i think djing is cool because
                                        it can function as a really gorgeous storytelling medium for both the performer
                                        and the listener. i'm very inspired by artists like CCL and DJ Voices.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>i love photography and im extremely drawn to interesting textures. 
                                        i shoot on a Sony RX100 VI and a Canon SD1300 (the blue one :3) running <a href="https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/CHDK">CHDK</a>.
                                        if you want to get into photography you should get the shittiest camera possible 
                                        because limitations make you better. you should also find a photographer who inspires you
                                        and try to replicate their style. i learned a lot from trying to replicate ernst haas' work,
                                        even if it's not some of my favorite photography.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>i love source engine, i've spent thousands of hours
                                        bunnyhopping and it means the world to me. it's the most beautiful art form i've ever seen
                                        in a videogame and there is almost nothing in this world that compares to the flow state
                                        or the feeling you get when you are fully engaged in a run. it's why this website has the 
                                        url that it has and why i have a tattoo of bunnies hopping on my arm.

                                        i love cooking and i love coffee. i'm most familiar with chinese or korean cuisine
                                        and i make a killer suan la fen. i make pour over coffee every day and i adore naturally 
                                        processed light roasted beans that taste like fruit. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        i love toys im a big toy fan You should get some cool toys that you like because they're awesome.
                                        i like balisongs and people are sleeping on begleri and knucklebones They are so satisfying
                                        and Epic .
                                    </li>

                                        my favorite pen is the Caran D'ache ballpoint in white (thank u ellis) because it's gorgeous and it feels good
                                        and it doesn't make a click sound so you can click it without pissing anyone off. my second favorite
                                        pen is the Mitsubishi BOXY 100 because it has duel action for extension and retraction and each step
                                        has an unbelievably satisfying feel and sound. my third favorite pen is the Zebra SL-F1 mini.
                                        the action doesn't feel particularly amazing but it's the best telescoping pen i've ever used
                                        and it takes the universal D1 refill. it's the most convenient pen ever and i'm terrified to
                                        lose it because i got it in japan and it's discontinued and people are scalping them for like
                                        500x the price. if you ever see one of these you should buy it. But not the SL-F1 ST model because
                                        that one is bigger and ugly and takes less refills
