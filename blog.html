                        smell of apple and cinnamon during bloom. it 
                        tastes kind of very slightly fruity on the first note. develops into this rich nd sweet flavor. 
                        i'm getting some slight astringency on the aftertaste so i probably have to grind a bit courser.<br>
                        update 1: i ground coarser nd i did Not get the astringency so i Think i was right ! however i 
                        forgot to actually note down wht the coffee tasted lik becos i was Beasting Crazy Omega in Mahjong Gold Room.<br>
                        update 2: i ran it again with the same grind but my technique was better and i definitely dialed the grind too
                        course last time. going to bring it down like 3 stops next time and see, since it's a bit watery.</p>
